           <h2 class="h2">Why are they special?</h2>
           <div><p>

           </p></div>
           <div class="intro res1">
            <h3>NGC 474</h3><br>
            <p class="styl">
            It is an elliptical galaxy, which means that its shape is predominantly spheroidal or ellipsoidal rather than having a disk structure like spiral galaxies. The ellipticity of NGC 474 indicates that its stellar content is evenly distributed in all directions, without a pronounced arm or disk structure.
           </p></div>
           <div class="intro res2">
            <h3>SOMBREREO GALAXY </h3><br>
            <p class="styl">Amateur astronomers eagerly flock to the Sombrero Galaxy, so named because of its bright nucleus and large central bulge. Add in this spiral galaxy's easily evident dust lane and it looks like a sombrero in the sky.
           </p></div>
           <div class="intro res3">
            <h3>PORPOISE GALAXY</h3><br>
            <p class="styl">The Porpoise Galaxy it is considered a spiral galaxy due to its characteristic disk-shaped structure with curved arms. In its spiral arms, prolific star-making activity is observed, contributing to the galaxy's remarkable luminosity at various wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum, from visible light to radio waves and X-rays.<br>It features a dense central region known as the galactic core. In this region, a supermassive black hole is believed to exist, the mass of which is significantly greater than that of stellar black holes. The interaction between this black hole and the surrounding matter has profound implications for the dynamics and evolution of the galaxy as a whole.
           </p></div>
           <div class="intro res4">
            <h3>WHIRLPOOR</h3><br>
            <P class="styl">The Whirlpool Galaxy, officially known as M51a or NGC 5194, is a galaxy large enough and close enough to us that amateur astronomers can see it on a dark night with binoculars. The Whirlpool Galaxy was the first to be classified as a spiral galaxy and is particularly interesting for its interaction with the dwarf galaxy NGC 5195, one of the most well-known galactic interactions in astronomy. This impressive and hellish-looking picture shows the Whirlpool Galaxy in both visual light (on the left-showing its stars) and infrared light (on the right-showing its dust structure).
           </P></div>
           <div class="intro res5">
            <h3>NGC3314a&NGC3314b</h3><br>
            <p class="styl">
                Though these two galaxies look as though they're colliding, it's just a matter of perspective. From our vantage point on Earth, these two galaxies seem to overlap each other but are actually tens of millions of light years apart. Nonetheless, they produce one of the coolest and strangest galactic images ever recorded.
           </p></div>
           <div class="intro res6">
           <h3>SDSS J1038+4849</h3><br>
            <p class="styl">
                Galaxy cluster SDSS J1038+4849 is one of the coolest clusters we've ever found. Resembling a uniquely human figure (like the snowman on the asteroid Vesta from our Strange Things About the Universe list), everyone can see the smiling face of this galaxy. The eyes and nose are galaxies but the curved lines are due to gravitational lensing. Since the cluster has so much mass, it bends and distorts the light around it, creating this happy arc.
